# chart-tool-hackathon

Development of a web or desktop tool that will allow users with minimal technical skills to quickly and easily visualize various types of data.

The project is far from being complete, but I tried to make a functional prototype that:

- uses colors and spacing from the task description
- allows users to upload data in CSV, JSON, or Excel format
- allows users to choose the type of chart they want to generate
- allows users to choose the x and y axis of the chart and data sheet (for excel files)
- allows users to export the chart as PNG, SVG, PDF or print (PDF and print works the same way, as PDF generation is too complex to implement in such a short timeframe)
- is responsive and accessible (to some extent, as accessibility is never perfect)

The main goal of this project was to make a usable prototype, but pay as much attention to the responsiveness and accessibility as possible.
